Kalax is a Rust library for Time Series Feature Extraction.

# Origin of the Name
Kalax is a portmanteau of two Sanskrit concepts, representing the essence of time-series analysis:

- Kāla (काल): Time — The fundamental flow and dimension of data.
- Lakṣaṇa (लक्षण): Feature — The distinctive marks and characteristics of a dataset.

The terminal "x" stands for Extraction. Together, Kalax signifies the "Signs of Time," reflecting our mission to distill raw temporal data into meaningful, high-performance features using Rust.
